# Tests builder

This is a WinForms application made for school project.

It`s a tool for creating tests in HTML file format. It converts images to base64 string and puts it directly into file. So you can have only one .html file even if you use images in questions.

You can find TestsBuilder.exe file in TestsBuilder\bin\Debug folder. 
(.exe file needs an img.jpg file in the folder for sample test)

## Note

It`s an old project that needs to be rewrited.
